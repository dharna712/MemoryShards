# Status Log

Running log of what's done, what's in progress, and what's next. Update this on
every commit that changes project direction or completes a milestone.

## 2026-09-12

- Topic finalized (was decided 2026-08-22, formalized here): AI memory
  reconstruction from fragmented digital data.
- Phase 1 evaluation starts 2026-09-14 (lab evaluation, no fixed deliverable
  format announced — treating it as: problem statement + dataset choice +
  working baseline pipeline).
- Repo scaffolded: `context/`, `data/`, `notebooks/`, `src/`.
- Data strategy decided: public geotagged/timestamped photo dataset for
  training, own personal photos/chat export as qualitative test-time demo.
- Not yet done: dataset sourced/downloaded, no code written, no model run.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Confirm and download training dataset.
- [ ] EXIF extraction + reverse geocoding script.
- [ ] Event clustering (DBSCAN on time+geo).
- [ ] Captioning model integration (BLIP/CLIP).
- [ ] Timeline fusion + rendering.
- [ ] Run qualitative demo on own photos before Sept 14.
